## Additional Notes
- If more time were available, full CRUD capabilities could be implemented to allow users to create, update, and delete cheese types, as well as read them.
- The Dockerfile could be refined to work in a production build environment.
- Improvements could be made to the separation of concerns by splitting the code into more components, enhancing maintainability and readability.
